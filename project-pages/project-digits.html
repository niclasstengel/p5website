            the task in which "ascii exploration" was created was to look at perlin noise. the p5sketch was supposed to
            find another application outside the course context.
          </p>
          <p class="is-body paragraph">
            as the name suggests, the sketch is heavily influenced by ascii art. the code was originally meant to
            capture movement via camera or webcam and display it on the ascii grid. to scale it down a bit and adapt it
            to my coding skills, it ended up being a sketch with a ball that moves around on the canvas based on a noise
            curve.
          </p>
          <p class="is-body paragraph">
            the code is actually quite simple. first a grid is created with the different characters. they are all
            individual objects with an own hitbox. the floating ball has a radius and its own hitbox aswell. if the
            hitbox of the ball intersects with the hitbox of the characters, it changes from character to number,
            resulting in the shape of a ball within the grid.
          </p>
          <p class="is-body paragraph">
            one problem with the code is that all characters get the same color value and therefore the sketch is
            monochrome. another disadvantage is the principle of changing from character to number by the collision of
            the hitboxes. because the hitboxes are fixed, you can only use simple geometric shapes, otherwise it becomes
            extremely complicated to calculate the hitbox. my first thought was to work based on pixel values, but so
            far I haven't found a solution that doesn't crash my browser.
